# Web-Scraping-Brands-and-their-Parent-Companies-from-Wikipedia
As part of a project, I needed to collect the names of major cosmetic brands and their parent companies. Wikipedia seemed to be  a good place to start. 

This code scrapes the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cosmetics_brands for its list of cosmetic brands and then retrieves the name of its parent company and owner(s) from its link on the page.
